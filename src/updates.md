# ISSUES

- When you delete a task from inbox, if the same task
  exists in another project it doesn't delete it

- The first project of "Inbox" is "hard to delete"

- When you delete a project, the first project
  replicates all of the tasks from "Inbox"

- project "select" html is listing the wrong projects
  (after deleting projects)

- "Inbox" can add tasks of the same name if you add a task with the same name as the task in "Inbox" to another project (solution: make it so that it checks MainStorage for duplicate names)

- can't click on the middle of task delete buttons (bubbling issue again)

# ADDITIONS

- Improve UI appearance
- When adding a task with the same name, put an warning that you can't do that
