# ISSUES

DONE: When you delete a task from inbox, if the same task
exists in another project it doesn't delete it

DONE: When you delete a task from a project that isn't from inbox, if the same task
exists in "Inbox" delete it

DONE: project "select" html is listing the wrong projects
(after deleting projects)

DONE: "Inbox" can add tasks of the same name if you add a task with the same name as the task in "Inbox" to another project (solution: make it so that it checks MainStorage for duplicate names)

DONE: can't click on the middle of task delete buttons (bubbling issue again)


- When you delete a task from a project, navigate to another project, and come back to the original project the "deleted" task reappears

# ADDITIONS

- Improve UI appearance
- When adding a task with the same name, put an warning that you can't do that
- set task to completed
- "Enter" and "Escape" keys for creating tasks/projects
